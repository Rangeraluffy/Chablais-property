# Peillex Real Estate

This is the Capstone Project for the Web Application Development Program. This project was developed by Alexandre Marolleau, as a final step to complete the full program of EPFL Extension School.

The main goal of this project is to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired while completing the 4 courses included in the WAD program:

1. HTML and CSS
2. Interactive web pages
3. Introduction to Ruby on Rails
4. Dynamic web applications
The app has been deployed in Heroku to the following URL: https://aqueous-plateau-25318.herokuapp.com/.

## The "Peillex Real Estate " application

"Peillex Real Estate" was imagined like a redesign of an already existing real estate agency on the Chablais market. To give a new style with a very competitive market. The administrator can create accounts for agents who work in this agency and thus published news related to the real estate market or simply new mandates for the sale of houses or apartments.

The application was developped using the following conpcepts and technologies:

### HTML & CSS

- HTML5
- CSS and SASS
- Atomic design

### JavaScript

- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Asynchronous requests.
- External JS libraries ([Choices.js](https://jquery.com/)).

### Ruby on Rails

- Basic Ruby on Rails framework concepts (Models, Views, Controllers, Routes).
- Databases associations.
- Automated tests.
- Authetication and authorizations.
- Locales.
- Uploads and files management.
- Third party services integration (AWS, Heroku, APIs).
