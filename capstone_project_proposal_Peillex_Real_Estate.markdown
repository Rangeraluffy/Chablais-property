## Project overview

Originally from **Haute-Savoie** between **Douvaine** and **Allinges**, I was able to **watch the evolution of the real estate market** over time. Haute-Savoie is well positioned in terms of property sales thanks to the purchasing power of cross-border commuters and the influence of *Switzerland* and its International Airport on the econmy of the department.

I worked for **2 years** in the company Moynat Peillex located in the center of Thonon-les-Bains. It is a family agency which aexits since **1861**. This company has a very good reputation thanks to its work and the time of establishment in this sector. Unfortunately, with time comes the change and the digitalisation/ The brand image of this company has taken a hit, when buyer is looking for a property, he goes through sites such as "**Leboncoin**" to take the first information and are then redirected to the website of the company.

For the French, real estate and digital technology are now inseparable: *more than 80% of buyers use online services or digital tools to complete their real estate purchase project*.

It was therefore important for me to renew this image brand by firstly passing through the agency's showcasing site. By adding new functionality and refreshing the design.
