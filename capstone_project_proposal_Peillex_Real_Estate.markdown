# Capstone project proposal outline

Use the Markdown format to write and submit your project proposal.

_Markdown is a simple way to format plain text._  You can read [a detailed background about markdown here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and get [a quick reference and intro to markdown here](http://commonmark.org/help/).

Use the headings and notes below to guide your proposal.  Stick to these headings and include as much detail about what you want your project to do.

## Project overview

You need to select a real-world scenario where a web application will provide a useful internet-based tool to a group of people.  The scenario should be similar in scope the the My Bucket List application.  The proposal will need to include a detailed plan of what the scenario or problems is that you wish to tackle, the list of features that will be needed, what each feature is for, and any particular front-end and back-end parts needed to build those.  Use the following points to outline your proposal.

## Application purpose

Write a one or two paragraph summary of the application purpose, answering the following questions:

* Who will use the application?
* Why it is needed and useful?

## Front end

Describe any interactive elements that will be needed in the application and what purpose they serve.

## Data structures and models

List the important models that will need to exist in the application for it to function as you intend, and indicate how those models are associated with each other.  Include any important attributes for these model.

## Third party services

Include a list of all third party services that you envisage using in your project.  For each one, indicate what they will be used for.  These include:
